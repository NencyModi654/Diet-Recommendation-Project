✅ Step 1: Apply fuzzy rules to user input
✅ Step 2: Get fuzzy result (e.g., "Low Carb Diet")
✅ Step 3: Search matching meals from dataset
✅ Step 4: Build and send the meal plan
✅ Step 5: Show result in frontend
✅ Step 6: (Optional) Collect feedback
1. Without Training → Static Fuzzy System
You:

Manually design fuzzy membership functions

Manually write fuzzy rules (e.g., IF BMI is High → Recommend Low Calorie Diet)

Use your dataset only to recommend meals that match fuzzy output

✅ This works well if your system is:

Based on expert knowledge

Meant to work with fixed logic

Simple and rule-based

📌 No training needed — just rule applicatio

[ User Inputs ]
     ↓
+----------------------+
|   Age, BMI, Activity |
+----------------------+
     ↓
[ Fuzzification ]
   (convert to degrees of membership)
     ↓
+---------------------------------------------+
| e.g., Age = 36                              |
| → 0.2 Young, 0.8 Middle-aged, 0.0 Elderly   |
+---------------------------------------------+
     ↓
[ Apply Fuzzy Rules ]
   (e.g., IF BMI is Obese AND Activity is Low → Calories = Deficient)
     ↓
[ Aggregation ]
   (combine outputs of all rules)
     ↓
[ Defuzzification ]
   (convert fuzzy output to crisp value like 2200 kcal)
     ↓
[ Recommend Meals ]
   (filter dataset to suggest food within calorie range)


Step-by-step Example:
✅ User visits form → inputs age, height, weight, activity level, etc.

✅ Frontend submits form (HTML/React form) → sends data to backend (Flask or Django route)

✅ Backend receives input → calculates BMI → fuzzifies inputs using your fuzzy functions

✅ Fuzzified values are used to apply fuzzy rules and generate recommendations

✅ Output is shown to the user (diet plan, advice, etc.)

# YESSS! 💡 You're absolutely thinking in the **right direction** now!

# You **don’t want to recommend food just based on disease** — you want to make it **personalized** using:

# ✅ **All factors** like:
# - Age  
# - BMI  
# - Activity Level  
# - Dietary Preference  
# - Disease  

# So let me show you **how to combine everything** in a clean, step-by-step way. You're gonna love this 💥

# ---

# ## 🔄 How to Combine Fuzzy Logic + Disease + Other Factors

# ### ✅ Step 1: Take All User Inputs

# | Factor              | Example Input    |
# |---------------------|------------------|
# | Age                 | 45               |
# | Height & Weight     | 1.65m, 70kg       |
# | Activity Level      | Moderate         |
# | Dietary Preference  | Vegetarian       |
# | Disease             | Diabetes         |

# ---

# ### ✅ Step 2: Preprocessing

# - Calculate BMI:
# ```python
# bmi = weight / (height ** 2)
# ```

# ---

# ### ✅ Step 3: Fuzzify the Inputs  
# Using the membership functions you already built:
# ```python
# age_fuzzy = fuzz.interp_membership(age_range, age_middle_mf, user_age)
# bmi_fuzzy = fuzz.interp_membership(bmi_range, bmi_overweight_mf, bmi)
# activity_fuzzy = fuzz.interp_membership(activity_range, activity_moderate_mf, user_activity)
# ```

# ---

# ### ✅ Step 4: Apply Fuzzy Rules  
# Example fuzzy rule:
# ```python
# IF age is middle AND bmi is overweight AND activity is moderate
# THEN recommend moderate-calorie, low-sugar diet
# ```

# You’ll use `skfuzzy.control` to set up rules like this and get output like:
# - Calorie range
# - Food type (high-protein, low-fat, etc.)

# ---

# ### ✅ Step 5: Get Disease-Specific Foods  
# From your disease list:
# ```python
# if disease == "Diabetes":
#     disease_foods = ["Oats", "Leafy greens", "Brown rice", "Low-sugar fruits"]
# ```

# ---

# ### ✅ Step 6: Filter/Enhance Fuzzy Output Using Disease

# Let’s say the fuzzy system recommends:
# > “Low calorie & high fiber diet”

# Then you cross-match with disease-safe food list:
# > Only show foods from `disease_foods` that are **low-calorie & high-fiber**

# ---

# ### ✅ Step 7: Consider Dietary Preference  
# Finally, if user is **vegetarian**, filter out non-veg items.

# ---

# ### ✅ Final Recommendation  
# Combine all logic and display:
# ```python
# Recommended Foods:
# - Oats
# - Leafy spinach
# - Apple
# - Brown rice

# Diet Plan:
# - 1600–1800 kcal/day
# - Avoid sugary drinks and processed carbs
# ```

# ---

# ## 🔧 How to Code This?
# You’ll need:
# 1. Your fuzzy rule system (already halfway done ✅)
# 2. A disease → food mapping (CSV or dictionary)
# 3. A simple filter function that matches:
#    - Fuzzy output → food traits (low-calorie, etc.)
#    - Disease-allowed foods
#    - Dietary preference
